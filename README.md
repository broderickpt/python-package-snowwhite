Python Module for SnowWhite
===========================

This is the prototype Python front end for the SPIRAL project's SnowWhite system, which compiles high-level specifications of numerical computations into hardware-specific optimized code.  It supports a variety of CPU's as well as Nvidia and AMD GPU's on systems running Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

SnowWhite was developed under the DARPA PAPPA (Performant Automation of Parallel Program Assembly) program.  The program focused on ways reduce the complexity of building software that takes advantage of the massive parallelism of advanced high-preformance computing systems.
